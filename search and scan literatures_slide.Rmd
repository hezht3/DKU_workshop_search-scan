# 1. Why do we need to search literature systematically?


# 1.1 Why do we need to search literature systematically?

* Why do we need to conduct a systematic review?
    + Evidence is overwhelming but inconsistent

* Why do we need to systematically review literatures in our studies?
    + Ensure not to duplicate the work of others
    + Gain insights from other's work

    
# 1.2 What is a Systematic Review?

* Focuses on a specific question

* Uses explicit, pre-planned scientific methods to **identify, select, appraise, and summarize** similar but separate studies

* Cochrane handbook:
    + Systematic reviews seek to **collate evidence that fits pre-specified eligibility criteria** in order to answer **a specific research question**. They aim to **minimize bias** by using explicit, systematic methods documented in advance with a protocol.


# 1.3 Types of reviews

* All reviews
    + Reviews that are not systematic (traditional, narrative reviews)
    + Systematic reviews
        - **Qualitative** systematic reviews
        - **Quantitative** systematic reviews: systematic reviews with **meta-analyses**

# 2. How to conduct a systematic electrical searching


# 2.1 Starting point for developing a search strategy: break your research question into concepts (PICOS)

* consider the main concepts being examined in a review: **PICOS**
    + The **review PICO** (planned at the protocol stage) is the **PICO** on which eligibility of studies is based (what will be included and what excluded from the review).
    + The **PICO of the included studies** (determined at the review stage) is what was actually investigated in the included studies.
* PICOS
    + **P**opulation
    + **I**ntervention(s)
    + **C**omparison(s)
    + **O**utcome
    + **S**tudy design


# 2.1.1 Components of research questions: "PICOS/PECOS" principle

* **P**: Patients or populations
    + Define condition or disease, including explicit diagnostic criteria
    + Population and setting of interest (age, race, sex, community, hospital, outpatient)
* **I/E**: Intervention/exposure
    + Timing of exposures
    + Route of administration
    + Dose intensity
    + Duration of exposure or therapy
* **C**: Comparison group(s)
    + For trials: placebo, standard therapy, no treatment
    + For epi: no exposure, non-cases (hospital, neighborhood, etc.)
* **O**: Outcome
    + Criteria for defining
    + Important to cunsumers, providers
    + Unpublished data?
* **S**: Study design
    + Experimental studies or observational studies (Levels of evidence: <https://www.cebm.ox.ac.uk/resources/levels-of-evidence/oxford-centre-for-evidence-based-medicine-levels-of-evidence-march-2009>)
    + Details of study design, eg. placebo in control group, endpoint blinding, follow-up time


# 2.2.2 Examples of breaking down the research questions

* Combined lifestyle factors, all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies
    + P: N/A (without the outcome of interests at the start of the study)
    + E: combined lifestyle factors (healthy?)
    + C: combined lifestyle factors (non-healthy?)
    + O: all-cause mortality and cardiovascular disease
    + S: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies

* Lifestyle factors, cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in middle-aged and elderly women: a systematic review and meta-analysis
    + P: middle-aged and elderly women (without the outcome of interests at the start of the study)
    + E: lifestyle factors (healthy?)
    + C: lifestyle factors (non-healthy?)
    + O: cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality
    + S: a systematic review and meta-analysis (of cohort studies)


# 2.2 Structure of a search strategy

* **Comparators/outcomes** typically may not be well described in the title or abstract of an article and are often not well indexed with controlled vocabulary terms

* A search strategy will typically has:
    + terms to search for the health condition of interest, i.e. the **population**
    + terms to search for the **intervention(s)** evaluated
    + terms to search for the types of **study design** to be included

* Structure:
    + **a broad set of search terms** gathered for each concept
    + combined with the **OR** Boolean operator to achieve sensitivity within concepts
    + combined with the **AND** Boolean operator for results of each concept
    
* **Structure from my point of view:**
    + **word[field] + logic**


# 2.2.1 Word

# 2.2.1.1 Find synonyms for text words

* You need to start with **simple search strategy**

* Start with the general format:
    + (Population OR synonym #1 OR synonym #2) AND
    + (Intervention OR synonym #1 OR synonym #2) AND
    + [if applicable] (Comparator OR synonym #1 OR synonym #2) AND
    + [if applicable] (Outcome OR synonym #1 OR synonym #2)
    + Add study type filter terms

```


* Use **key words** and **mesh terms** in known articles to expand synonyms and build search strategy


# 2.2.1.2 Use **controlled vocabulary** when available

* **text words** and **controlled vocabulary**
    + **text word**: the terms occurring in the title, abstract, or other fields
    + **controlled vocabulary**: standardized subject terms assigned to the references by indexers

* Use both **text words** and **controlled vocabulary**
    + If you use only keywords, you could miss articles that don’t use your precise terms
    + If you use only controlled vocabulary, you could miss articles that have not been indexed yet or that have older indexing

# Example
* Take this article as an example "Zhang Y, Pan X F, Chen J, et al. Combined lifestyle factors and risk of incident type 2 diabetes and prognosis among individuals with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies[J]. Diabetologia, 2020, 63(1): 21-33."
* "In brief, the search terms included the Medical Subject Heading terms and related exploded versions as well as keywords in titles or abstracts related to the following themes: ‘diabetes’, ‘cardiovascular disease’, ‘cancer’, ‘mortality’, ‘combined’, ‘lifestyle’ and ‘cohort studies’. The search themes were then combined using the Boolean operator ‘or’ for the four health outcomes (diabetes, CVD, cancer and mortality) and then combined with other themes using ‘and’."
* You can try to find synonyms based on the brief search strategy the author provided here, and to try to search on PubMed and MEDLINE, and to see how many articles your search strategy will retrieve, and how many articles the author's search strategy will retrieve.
* You can also try to modify the search strategy the author provided, eg. to use combin*[Title/Abstract] instaed of "combination[Title/Abstract] OR combinations[Title/Abstract] OR combined[Title/Abstract]", and to see how the searching result changes.

# 2.4 Document your searching


# 2.4.1 Bibliographic Management Software
* Download and store results of electronic searches in EndNote
    + EndNote is most popularly used, and is also purchased by Duke and DKU for faculty, staff, and students
    + EndNote 20 version is not quite perfect, so I still recommend you to use EndNote X9
    + Win and Mac version can be downloaded here: <https://duke.box.com/s/yp0k9jro6t4247we6f0xv2xn2ndkqiz1>
* Other similar softwares
    + ProCite
    + Reference Manager
    + RefWorks
    + QUOSA
    + Mendeley: good to be used in reading fulltext <https://www.mendeley.com/?interaction_required=true>
    + Sciwheel: also Duke support, online interface <https://duke.box.com/s/7k9ec7vf4rnr3rh1c0f8qoiiprdf3yr6>

# 2.5 Systematic Snowballing

* Use included articles as a source to identify missing studies:
    + Reference lists: Check **cited** articles = backward searching
    + Web of Science, SCOPUS: Check **citing** articles = forward searching
    + “Related articles”/ “Find Similar” in MEDLINE and Embase: Also could use to find new terms to expand your search strategy


# 2.6 PRISMA Flow of Information
* To keep record of complicated searching and scanning, I strongly encourage you to document infromation in PRISMA flow diagram. Details can be found here: <http://www.prisma-statement.org/PRISMAStatement/FlowDiagram>
![Caption](F:/Box Sync/Duke Kunshan University Intern/4 Diet/Group meeting coordination/search and scan literatures/image/25 PRISMA flow diagram.PNG)


# 2.7 Summary on searching

* Create a comprehensive, sensitive searching (comprehensive vs. sensitive)

* Starting with your question/PICOS, build the search strategy on the structure of word, field, and logic

* Use all electronic resources

* Document when, where, and how you searched and what you found


# 3. How to conduct study selection?


# 3.1 The process of study selection

* Import all citation records retrieved from all databases, remove duplicates (both electronic and manually), set up a reference library
    + Electronic: In EndNote, select **Reference**, **Find duplicates**
    + Manual: recommend to perform at least 2 rounds, first sort literature by **Author** and remove duplicates, and sort literature by **Title** and remove duplicates

* Scan literature by **Title/Abstract**, remove articles that are clearly not fit with your research topic

# 3.2 Study selection critera: build based on **PICOS**

* **P**opulation
    + diagnostic criteria of diseases
    + main characteristics of participants
    + demographic characteristics
    + research institutions
    + who make the diagnosis
    + participants needed to be excluded from systematic review
    + how to deal with studies only contained a subgroup of the study population
    
* **I**ntervention/**E**xposure/**C**omparison
    + what is the intervention/exposure/comparison of interests
    + how to deal with heterogeneity in intervention, eg. doses, treatment period
    + how to deal with studies only contained part of the intervention of interests
    + how to deal with studies not only included the intervention of interests

* **O**utcome
    + whether the outcome is of significance to patients and decision-makers in clinical work
    + primary outcomes are 2 or 3 of the target outcomes
    + secondary outcomes are the rest target outcomes, or outcomes to evaluate the effects of the interventions
    + outcomes should contain potential or certified adverse-effect
    + consider all outcomes that are related to decision-making, including economic factors
    + consider the scope and time for evluating the outcomes

* **S**tudy design
    + Experimental studies or observational studies (Levels of evidence: <https://www.cebm.ox.ac.uk/resources/levels-of-evidence/oxford-centre-for-evidence-based-medicine-levels-of-evidence-march-2009>)


# 3.3 Critical points in study selection

* The **sequence** of study selection criteria

* Study selection is a **subjective** process

* **Blinding**

* **Pilot studies**

* Follow your **protocol**

* Document the reasons for **exclusion**


# Thank you

* Similar to programming, it is hardly possible to cover all details in a workshop

* The fastest way to progress is to **try it**, and to find solutions when meeting problems

* Hopefully you will find this process interesting and good luck
